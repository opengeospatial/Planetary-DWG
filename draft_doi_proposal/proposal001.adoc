# Proposal for Modification to the DataCite Metadata Schema

## Introduction

In the realm of scientific research, Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) serve as a cornerstone of open science, 
providing a means for researchers to publish the results of their work and high-level products. However, these 
results are not frequently archived in permanent repositories such as those maintained by the Planetary Data 
System (PDS) and the European Space Agency (ESA). Researchers frequently need to access information related 
to celestial bodies, and publications referenced by DOIs are a valuable resource. However, querying and locating 
data associated with specific celestial bodies, such as Mars, proves to be a challenging task when retrieving metadata 
linked to DOIs. This proposal aims to address this issue by enhancing the DataCite Metadata Schema (https://schema.datacite.org/) 
to better support the needs of planetary science research.

## Use Cases

**Case 1**: As a scientist, I want to search for all publications related to a specific celestial body, such as Mars.

**Case 2**: As a scientist, I want to search for all publications related to a specific type of celestial object, 
for example, asteroids. This is essential for compiling a database of orbital parameters and asteroid composition.

**Case 3**: As a scientist, I want to find Martian data within a specific geopolygon.

## Proposed Modifications

To address the challenges presented in the use cases, we propose the following modifications to the DataCite Metadata Schema:

### 3.1 Addition of Celestial Body Name to DOI Metadata

- The name of the celestial body associated with the research data or publication shall be added to the DOI metadata.

The best practice is to use the official designation of the target as defined by IAU. This parameter is case sensitive 
(mixing lower/upper cases) and all values must use the standard spelling and case; unusual characters 
(such as intermediate spaces) are allowed, except quotes and hashes (preferably changed to _). Data providers must be 
aware that services which do not expose the IAU designations will not return answers to queries using them. Conversely, 
users must be aware that some data of interest might not be visible if they do not use the recommended IAU nomenclature 
for planetary bodies. The quaero name resolver2 from IMCCE may help data providers (as well as users) to handle multiple 
denominations; it is available from the VESPA portal to support queries.

Concerning celestial objects (at fixed position, i.e., stars, galaxies…) the name should be identifiable through Simbad3.

Other best practices are listed below:

- The Exoplanet Encyclopedia provides a nearly complete list of currently known extrasolar planets: http://exoplanet.eu/index.php
- Meteorite catalogues can be found here: http://www.nhm.ac.uk/research-curation/research/projects/metcat/search/indexsing.dsml and http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/index.php.
- The catalog of lunar samples is available here: http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/samples/
- Other planetary samples are listed in topical web sites, e.g., samples from the Stardust mission are described here: http://curator.jsc.nasa.gov/stardust/catalog/
- Consortia such as the IGSN4 issue IDs for samples
- Asteroids: Usage is to use preferably name (if it exists) or principal designation (the number is not used here, it can be included in alt_target_name)
- Meteors: the IAU Meteor Data Center assigns IDs to meteors and meteor showers
- Calibration targets: values can relate to existing names in a given archive (e.g., the PSA contains values such as bias, checkout, dark, flatfield, internal source…)


### 3.2 Addition of Celestial Object Type

- A list of values defining the type of celestial object (e.g., planet, moon, asteroid) shall be incorporated into the metadata 
schema. This parameter identifies the type of the target. Solar System bodies are defined without ambiguity by the couple 
celestial object type and object name. In other cases, targets may have no proper name (i.e., samples), but the object type 
parameter must contain a value in all cases. The possible values for objcet types are:
- asteroid
- dwarf_planet
- planet
- satellite
- comet
- exoplanet
- interplanetary_medium
- sample
- sky
- spacecraft
- spacejunk
- star
- calibration

### 3.3 Inclusion of Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS) for Geopolygons

- Coordinate Reference Systems associated with geopolygons referenced in the directory found at [https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/IAU](https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/IAU) shall be included in the metadata.
- This modification ensures that researchers can precisely locate data within geopolygons related to planetary surfaces.

## What Change Would You Like to See in the DataCite Metadata Schema?

We propose extending the DataCite Metadata Schema to include essential information about celestial bodies, 
celestial object types, and coordinate reference systems for geopolygons. This addition will empower researchers to 
efficiently locate and utilize planetary science research data associated with DOIs.

## What Problem Would This Change Solve—and For Whom?

This change addresses the problem of inefficiency in searching and accessing planetary science research data referenced by DOIs. 
It benefits the scientific community by:

- Facilitating streamlined searches for research data related to specific celestial bodies.
- Enabling the compilation of comprehensive databases for specific types of celestial objects.
- Enhancing the precision and utility of geospatial data by providing the necessary coordinate reference systems.

## What Workarounds Do You Currently Use (If Any) to Get Around This Problem?

Currently, planetary science researchers rely on inefficient manual methods to find celestial bodies or object types 
specific to DOIs. These workarounds often result in considerable waste of time and resources.

By implementing the proposed changes, these workarounds will become unnecessary and researchers will be able to directly 
access the information they need to advance their work in planetary science.
